Task 0
'''
This is O(7) which approximates as O(1) as we just go to the first and last entry and get the information and the number of
entries doesnt change the algorithm time.
'''

Task1
'''
This algorithm worst case time seems to be O(2n + 1) which approximates to O(n) as it only must make two calls per item in the calls list.
'''

Task2
'''
This algorithm worst case time is O(4n) or approximately O(n) as it must go through each individual call to 
pull out the time and update the calls to find the greatest.
'''

Task3
'''
I believe this code is O(6n + n log n) or approximately O(n log n).  It will go through and check each call if it was made from bangladore it would make 
4 calls.  Then we have conversion to a set and back to a list to be sorted. The sort algorithm is n log n on the worst case.
'''

Task4
"""
This algorithm would be O(2(n)^2 + n + n log n) which approximates to O(n^2) if we 
consider that going through the text list is the same as going through the calls list and the calls are our actual input
otherwise we would need multiple variables for input.
